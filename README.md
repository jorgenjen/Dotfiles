## My dotfiles

These dotfles are for both my hyprland and qtile window managers as I use both in addition to other configurations of programs such as neovim. The main purpose of this repo is for backup and easy install on new computers.

Qtile config is a modification of the old version of [Cozytile](https://github.com/Darkkal44/CozyTile) by github user Darkkal44.

Hyprland is a slight modification of the amazing [dotfiles repository](https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles) by Stephan Raabe.

Neovim is fully my own configuration using the lazy package manager
